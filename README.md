# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
## Abstract
One of the most difficult problems in natural language processing is audio emotion classification. In this project, we investigate various neural networks for identifying the emotions of input audio with the goal of achieving reasonable accuracy. We discovered a CNN architecture that processes audio spectrograms and gives audio emotion classification accuracy of 7 emotions using half of the TESS dataset after experimenting with several architectures.
